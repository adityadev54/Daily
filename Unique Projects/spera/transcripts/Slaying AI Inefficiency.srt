1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
You know, in the world of artificial intelligence, there's this massive, hidden dragon that every

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,199
researcher, every company is desperately trying to slay. And it's not a lack of data or a shortage

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,379
of brilliant minds. No, it's something way more fundamental than that. So what is this dragon?

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,039
What's the one thing that's really holding back the next wave of AI breakthroughs? You know,

5
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,399
the stuff that could cure diseases or help solve climate change? Believe it or not,

6
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,100
The answer is kind of simple, almost mundane, really. It's inefficiency. The sheer amount of time

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,159
and computational power it takes to teach an AI model anything, it's just staggering. It's like

8
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,759
we're building these incredible superhighways, but forcing our AI to learn how to drive stuck in first

9
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:48,299
gear. So we keep throwing all this amazing hardware at the problem, but what if the problem isn't the

10
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,299
engine? What if it's the map we're using? The real breakthrough, it turns out, isn't just about

11
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:58,920
training harder, it's about training smarter. And that brings us to this whole quest for something

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,000
called optimization. I want you to think about it like this. Training an AI is like trying to find

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,359
the absolute lowest point in a massive, complicated mountain range, but you have to do it in a super

14
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,340
thick fog. So for years, the standard way we've done this is with something called first order

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,780
optimization. Okay, so you're in that foggy valley, you can't see a thing. All you can do is feel the

16
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,739
right where you're standing. So you take a small step downhill, feel the slope again, take another

17
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:33,480
step. It works eventually, but it's this slow plotting process. You might end up zigzagging down

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,120
a gentle slope for hours, and you'd completely miss a much steeper, way faster path that was just a

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,439
few feet away. But what if the fog lifted just a little? That's what second order optimization is

20
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,280
like. Instead of just feeling the slope right under your feet, you can now see the curvature of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,280
the valley around you. You don't just see which way is down, you see how quickly it goes down.

22
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,019
You can see the whole shape of the terrain, which means you can aim directly for the bottom.

23
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:06,280
It is a total game changer. And you can literally see the difference here. On the left, first order

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,199
optimization sees the world in a straight line. It's looking at each piece of the puzzle on its own.

25
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,800
But over on the right, second order sees the whole picture, every single connection, every

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,199
relationship. It's the difference between looking at one single paving stone versus seeing the entire

27
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,919
map. Now, for a long, long time, being able to see that full map was just way too computationally

28
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,819
expensive. It was a beautiful idea in theory that just couldn't work in the real world with the

29
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:40,099
enormous AI models we use today. Until a new algorithm came along, one with a, well, a pretty

30
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:47,400
memorable name, to slay this dragon of inefficiency. It's called Shampoo. And its whole purpose is right

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,460
there in what its creators said. Shampoo was designed to bridge the gap. It finds this really

32
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,860
clever way to approximate that full map, all that second order information, but without the crippling

33
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,020
computational cost. It makes the power of seeing the whole terrain accessible for the very first

34
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,139
time at a massive scale. So how does it pull this off? Well, it's kind of like a brilliant

35
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:14,240
orchestra conductor. You've got the main GPU musicians playing the main melody, that's the AI

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,199
training, but Shampoo notices the CPU percussion section is just sitting there not doing much.

37
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,840
So it hands them a totally different piece of music, those complex map making calculations,

38
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:28,759
and tells them to play it at the same time. Nothing stops, nobody has to wait. It's just a

39
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:39,120
symphony of efficiency, using every part of the computer in perfect harmony. And all of this

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,620
speed up. We're not talking about a theoretical improvement here. This is about getting results

41
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,580
way faster. Researchers applied Shampoo to some of the largest, most complex models out there.

42
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,479
You know, models for machine translation, language understanding, ad prediction, and the results?

43
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,259
They were dramatic. And the results are just stunning. I mean, look at this. For a standard

44
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:04,819
transformer model, the kind that powers things like Google Translate, they didn't just shave off a

45
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:10,919
few minutes, they cut the training time nearly in half. And for the really big models, they saved

46
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:18,139
over 17 hours. That's not just an improvement, that's a revolution. Let that sink in. What this

47
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:23,019
means is that for some of the biggest, most important AI tasks in the world, we can now get

48
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:27,699
to the answer almost twice as fast. Just imagine what that does to the speed of discovery.

49
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:34,600
So this is way more than just a faster algorithm. This is about unlocking the future. When you can

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,740
dramatically reduce the time it takes to experiment and to innovate, you fundamentally change what's

51
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,860
even possible. So as we're emerging from that foggy valley, and we've got this much clearer map in

52
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,379
our hands, what are the key landmarks we should remember from this journey? Okay, first, remember

53
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:56,360
that one of AI's biggest dragons is just simple inefficiency, the time and the cost of training.

54
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,680
Second, the solution isn't always just more power. It's smarter methods like second order optimization

55
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,120
that give us a bird's eye view of the problem. And third, and this is the most important part,

56
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,339
making training faster means we accelerate the entire cycle of innovation, from a new idea

57
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:17,139
to a real breakthrough. Because this isn't just about faster computers. It's about faster cures.

58
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,399
It's about getting to a cancer treatment or a climate solution or a scientific discovery in half

59
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,100
the time. The real question isn't how much faster the AI can learn. It's how much faster we can build

60
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,420
a better world for everyone.
