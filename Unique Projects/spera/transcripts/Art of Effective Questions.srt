1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Did you know that over the course of your life,

2
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:05,120
you're probably gonna ask something like 20,000 questions?

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,080
20,000, but what if I told you that most of them

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,859
are actually the wrong ones?

5
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:13,039
Today, we're gonna get into the art of asking questions

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,880
that don't just get us answers, they change everything.

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,379
Just let that one sink in for a second.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,620
This isn't just some nice sounding idea,

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,920
it's a real, practical truth.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,000
Think about it.

11
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,739
The quality of your career, your relationships,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,219
even how happy you feel.

13
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:30,719
So much of that hinges on the kinds of questions

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,780
you're asking yourself and others.

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,600
So if our questions are that important,

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,939
it's absolutely crucial that we're not just asking

17
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,079
any old question, right?

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
We need to be asking the right one,

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,880
the one that really unlocks the door

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,920
to whatever comes next.

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,439
So let's start right here.

22
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,520
I want you to think of questions as the engine of your mind.

23
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,539
Seriously, without a question, your thinking just sits there.

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,320
It has no fuel, no direction.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,359
It's the question that's the spark

26
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,780
that gets the whole thing moving.

27
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,960
But here's the trap that so many of us fall into,

28
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,159
pretty much every day.

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,420
The questions we ask by default,

30
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,359
they're often like trying to open a door

31
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,700
with the totally wrong key.

32
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,420
They're just dead ends, and they keep us running around

33
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,540
in circles wondering why we're not getting anywhere.

34
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,579
Now, check this out.

35
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,060
This is a perfect example.

36
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,939
A tiny little change in wording

37
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,239
completely changes the world of possibilities.

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,200
Asking, can we meet the deadline?

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,500
That's a closed door.

40
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:24,920
It's a yes or a no.

41
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,060
It kind of invites fear and limitations.

42
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,780
But how might we meet the deadline?

43
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:30,900
See the difference?

44
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,040
That's an invitation.

45
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,980
It just assumes it's possible

46
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,359
and gets your brain to start looking for a way.

47
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,599
So how do we get better at this?

48
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,060
How do we start asking these powerful questions

49
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,040
more consistently?

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,640
Well, one of the best models I've ever seen

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,439
is something called the question pyramid.

52
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,659
Let's break it down.

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,140
It all starts with these familiar faces, doesn't it?

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
Kipling's six honest serving men.

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,079
I mean, these are the fundamental tools

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,340
in our question toolkit.

57
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,019
The words that kick off any search for an answer.

58
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,620
So let's picture these words on a pyramid.

59
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,280
The whole goal is to move up,

60
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,680
to climb from that wide fact gathering base

61
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,560
all the way to the sharp insight generating peak.

62
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,520
You ready?

63
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,699
Let's start climbing.

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,120
Okay, at the bottom, we've got the foundation.

65
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,900
Who, what, when, and where.

66
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,680
These are absolutely essential.

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,719
They give us the facts, they map out the landscape.

68
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,500
You can't build a house without a foundation, right?

69
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,879
But you can't live in just the foundation either.

70
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,379
Now, one level up, we find how and what if.

71
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,560
Okay, now things are starting to get interesting.

72
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,419
We're moving beyond just collecting data

73
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:39,039
and we're starting to explore processes and possibilities.

74
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,340
This is where creativity really starts to kick in.

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,639
And right here at the very peak,

76
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,840
we find the single most powerful question of them all.

77
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,780
Why?

78
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,099
You see, how tells us the process?

79
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,639
What gives us the facts?

80
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,439
But why gets to the absolute heart of the matter?

81
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,199
The purpose, the motivation,

82
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,099
the reason any of it is important.

83
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,340
This is where real insight lives.

84
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,599
So that pyramid is a really powerful framework.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,280
But you know, to truly master this whole thing,

86
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,419
we need to look at two hidden dimensions

87
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,379
that are always working behind the scenes,

88
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:12,979
scope and assumptions.

89
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,939
First up is scope.

90
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,719
The easiest way to think about this

91
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,719
is like the zoom lens on your camera,

92
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,180
asking how can I be more productive?

93
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,400
That's a narrow scope.

94
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:25,120
But asking how can our team be more productive?

95
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,680
Boom, you just widen the lens.

96
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,599
Instantly, you're thinking about more people,

97
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,419
more resources, more angles.

98
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,000
The most powerful questions

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,939
almost always have a wider scope.

100
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,520
Now, this second hidden dimension is even sneakier.

101
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,639
Assumptions.

102
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,500
Every single question you ask

103
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,120
is built on a pile of assumptions.

104
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,539
The question, how can we increase sales?

105
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,280
It just assumes that increasing sales is the right goal.

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,199
But what if the real goal is to increase profitability?

107
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:51,919
If you question that assumption,

108
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,819
you might realize you should be focusing

109
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,319
on cutting costs instead.

110
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,300
Until you find these hidden beliefs,

111
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,659
you risk solving the wrong problem perfectly.

112
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,539
So when you combine this idea of the pyramid

113
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,580
with an awareness of scope and assumptions,

114
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,199
you start to move beyond just a simple technique.

115
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,759
You actually start to adopt a whole new mindset,

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,439
a different way of being in the world.

117
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,159
And that brings us to the master himself, Socrates.

118
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,300
You know, for him, asking questions

119
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,000
wasn't some tool to use in a meeting.

120
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,000
It was the entire point of living a meaningful life.

121
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,300
It was about constant, humble inquiry.

122
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,620
So how do we actually practice this?

123
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,060
Well, the Socratic method can be broken down

124
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,779
into these four key directions.

125
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,639
The next time you have a strong belief,

126
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,079
don't just state it, pursue it.

127
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,160
Ask yourself, where did that belief come from?

128
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,899
What evidence is supporting it?

129
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,220
Who might disagree with me?

130
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,720
And what are the consequences

131
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,959
if I follow this belief all the way to the end?

132
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,220
This is how you really start to examine your own thinking.

133
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,779
Okay, I know that was a lot to take in.

134
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:52,899
So let's boil it all down to three really practical keys

135
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,000
you can start using the moment this is over.

136
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,519
First, climb the pyramid.

137
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,399
It's simple.

138
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,519
The next time you're about to ask a what or a when question,

139
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,879
just pause for a second.

140
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,519
See if you can rephrase it as a how or even better, a why.

141
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,600
It's a tiny shift, but it makes a huge difference.

142
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,300
Second key, widen your scope.

143
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,860
Before you ask your question, consciously zoom out.

144
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,600
Instead of just asking about your little piece of the puzzle,

145
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:19,079
ask about the whole picture.

146
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,860
Ask about what this means next month or even next year.

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,420
And third, and this one might be the most powerful of all,

148
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:27,819
challenge your assumptions.

149
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,360
Make it a habit to just ask yourself this one simple question,

150
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,620
what am I taking for granted right now?

151
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,560
That is the master key

152
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,800
that unlocks the invisible chains on your thinking.

153
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,639
Because ultimately, this is why all of this matters so much.

154
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,279
Asking effective questions

155
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,500
isn't just about finding some piece of information.

156
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,100
It's a creative act.

157
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,740
Questions are the tools we use to imagine

158
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,579
and then literally build a better reality for ourselves,

159
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,759
for our teams, and for our communities.

160
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,300
So I'll leave you with this one last question.

161
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,660
Based on everything we've just talked about,

162
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,860
what powerful question will you go out and ask today?
