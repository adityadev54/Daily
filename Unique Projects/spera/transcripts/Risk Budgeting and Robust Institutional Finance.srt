1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
All right, let's unpack this.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,419
We are diving deep into institutional finance today, and we are skipping right past the

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,259
entry-level stuff about simply diversifying your assets.

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,199
The biggest pools of capital, we're talking massive pension funds, endowments, they've

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:17,800
already moved on.

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,559
They really have.

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,859
The sources you've given us, they highlight this cutting-edge shift.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,800
It's no longer just about what assets you hold.

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,160
It's about what risk you own and how you precisely budget for it.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,039
We're going to be exploring the sophisticated methodologies that move way beyond basic asset

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:40,060
allocation, things like the risk budgeting approach and the comprehensive risk allocation

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,560
framework.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,520
And our mission here is to figure out how these giants manage the truly complex, the

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,060
illiquid parts of their portfolios, private equity, infrastructure.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,200
Really tricky stuff.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:50,920
Exactly.

17
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,000
And why they're focusing less on chasing returns and much more on building financial robustness,

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,679
on ensuring capital preservation.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,320
We want to find those the surprising facts that show why these complex methods are just

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,979
objectively better than the old ones.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,019
Well, we have to start with the fundamental realization that, you know, that drove this

22
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:08,459
change.

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,879
The major economic crises of the past generation, they profoundly exposed just how fragile traditional

24
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,079
asset management was.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,840
Oh, absolutely.

26
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,480
When the world melts down, relying on uncertain return forecasts, which are, I mean, they're

27
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:25,790
to the older models.

28
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,629
That's a recipe for disaster.

29
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,049
So the market effectively forced a migration.

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,370
Risk management had to become the absolute center of the investment process.

31
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,489
You had to prioritize models that just didn't require you to guess what returns would be

32
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:39,069
next year.

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,250
And that's where the theory of risk budgeting or RB really found its footing.

34
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,370
Everyone knows the concept of an equal weight portfolio, right?

35
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,349
Where every asset gets the same dollar amount.

36
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:48,849


37
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,390
RB is a generalization of the equal risk contribution or ERC portfolio.

38
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,310
Which means it's...

39
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,010
In an ERC, every asset contributes the same amount of risk to the total portfolio volatility.

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,230
OK, the same amount of risk.

41
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:07,609
But in the more general risk budgeting approach, the manager defines a specific budget of risk

42
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:08,469
for each component.

43
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,310
So maybe the budget for emerging market debt is 10% of total risk and the budget for stable

44
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,129
infrastructure is 5%.

45
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,129
The portfolio is then built so the actual risk contribution matches that defined budget.

46
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,090
And here's where it gets really interesting because this just blows up the major failure

47
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,710
of the older gold standard.

48
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,449
Mean Variance Optimization, MVO.

49
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,610
If RB works by defining risk contribution, what was MVO doing wrong?

50
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,250
MVO, for all its theoretical elegance, is practically brittle.

51
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,990
It operates beautifully on a whiteboard.

52
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:44,710
But when you implement it in the real world, its tendency is to maximize the effects of

53
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,030
errors in your input assumptions.

54
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:49,889
Think of it like trying to perfectly hit a tiny dartboard from a mile away.

55
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,969
If your return forecasts are even slightly off, and they always are, MVO pushes the portfolio

56
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:57,930
weights into these wild, extreme, and inefficient corners.

57
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,969
Wait, so MVO is?

58
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:03,310
It's theoretically optimal, but in practice it's just brittle.

59
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:09,469
It sounds like we're punishing ourselves for trying to be a little too precise when our

60
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,590
inputs are just fundamentally unreliable.

61
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,530
That's the trade-off.

62
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:13,250
Precisely.

63
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,650
So the quest for the perfect allocation actually leads to massive instability.

64
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,330
That's it.

65
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,310
RB portfolios are just significantly more robust.

66
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:24,969
They're far less sensitive to those changes in input parameters.

67
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,789
And that stability is actually a huge operational win, right?

68
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,069
It translates directly into much lower turnover.

69
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,270
So you're not paying transaction costs and chasing performance every time the market

70
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,849
data wiggles.

71
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:36,430
Exactly.

72
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:41,669
It's a construction method that values consistency and real-world stability over trying to nail

73
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:42,810
an uncertain forecast.

74
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,810
And the math, it backs this up so elegantly.

75
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,569
You don't even need a complicated formula.

76
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:48,289
Not at all.

77
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,129
When academics look at this, they found that the volatility of an RB portfolio is mathematically

78
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,349
guaranteed to be safely nestled somewhere between the absolute lowest possible risk

79
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:02,569
portfolio, the minimum variance one, and the simple equally weighted approach.

80
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,490
So you get the benefit of optimization without the inherent fragility of the MVO system.

81
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:07,949
That's it.

82
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,830
That's powerful proof of concept.

83
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,810
But the applications go far beyond typical stock and bond portfolios.

84
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,050
You highlighted a pretty surprising use in sovereign bond indexation.

85
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,350
This is a fantastic illustration of the need for risk-based thinking.

86
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,550
Traditional sovereign bond indexes are weighted by debt.

87
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,389
What's the massive paradox here?

88
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,490
You end up giving the highest index weightings to the most indebted country.

89
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,230
Exactly.

90
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,930
Regardless of their capacity to actually service that debt.

91
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,410
So you're rewarding poor fiscal management.

92
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,970
If you're a passive investor tracking that index, you are effectively taking on the most

93
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,509
exposure to the weakest hands.

94
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,230
You are indexing to the highest risk.

95
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,009
And that creates an inherent ongoing risk of index collapse if one of those highly weighted,

96
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:56,269
heavily indebted nations just hits a wall.

97
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,230
The risk budgeting solution completely sidesteps this.

98
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,750
Instead of basing the budget on the country's liability, its debt, you base the risk budget

99
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,129
on a more stable metric like its GDP.

100
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,089
So the stability of the economy rather than the amount it owes, that becomes the anchor

101
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:12,370
of your risk exposure.

102
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,569
It's a complete philosophical reversal.

103
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:20,250
So risk budgeting handles the relative risk contribution of portfolio components brilliantly.

104
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,850
But let's zoom out a bit to the entire portfolio construction process.

105
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,250
We're now talking about the full shift from asset allocation or AA to the risk allocation

106
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,829
framework, RAF.

107
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,009
Why is traditional AA obsolete for these large institutions?

108
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,949
Traditional asset allocation, simply sorting investments into these broad categories like

109
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,769
fixed income, equity, commodities.

110
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:45,829
It creates what we call a false sense of security.

111
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:46,910
A false sense of security.

112
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:53,290
When markets are calm, those buckets, they look diverse, but they mask common underlying

113
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,589
risk factors that all pop up when stress hits.

114
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,850
Like 2008, when everything correlated to one, you thought that high yield bonds were fixed

115
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,689
income, but when the economy contracted, they behaved exactly like equities.

116
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:04,829
Exactly like equities.

117
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:05,170
Yes.

118
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,170
Because they share the same credit risk exposure.

119
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,089
And the risk allocation framework acknowledges this systemic reality.

120
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,290
It shifts the focus from what asset you own to what risk you own.

121
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,769
It requires the manager to explicitly consider how investments contribute to or mitigate

122
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:27,470
risks like equity beta exposure, foreign currency fluctuations, or exposure to illiquidity.

123
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,930
So once you're operating under this RAF, how do institutions determine their policy goals

124
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,870
and measure success?

125
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:36,310
I mean, how do they avoid moving the goalposts?

126
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,529
The standard for success is raised significantly.

127
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:45,589
Policy goals have to be compared to a volatility equivalent simple stock bond portfolio.

128
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:45,910
OK.

129
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,449
What does that mean?

130
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,089
It means if your complicated, highly researched strategy has, say, a 10% expected volatility,

131
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,209
the objective is to add return over and above what you could have earned simply by investing

132
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:00,269
in a basic two asset stock bond portfolio that also has 10% volatility.

133
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,449
That forces massive transparency.

134
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,529
You can't just claim success because you made money.

135
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:09,230
You have to prove you added genuine alpha, not just compensated beta risk that was easily

136
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,329
achievable somewhere else.

137
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,949
And that framework requires dynamic monitoring to catch changes fast.

138
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:20,230
To spot spikes in risk sooner than conventional methods, they use this really interesting

139
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,769
solution called exponential weighting on historical data.

140
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,029
That's a fascinating technical detail.

141
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,790
Can you break down that system for us, the 24 monthly points with a 12-month half-life?

142
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:32,629
Sure.

143
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:38,029
Conventional methods treat data points from, say, 20 months ago and last month equally.

144
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,649
That's just slow to react.

145
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:40,269


146
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,889
Existential weighting is like driving a car.

147
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:42,410
Yeah.

148
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,709
You care far more about the pothole you hit three seconds ago than the one you hit five

149
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:46,269
minutes ago.

150
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,069
The 12-month half-life means that data from a year ago is weighted only half as much as

151
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,009
the most recent data.

152
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,610
So it accelerates the decay of old information's relevance.

153
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,449
It lets the system capture current risk and volatility spikes much sooner.

154
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:05,050
If a manager starts quietly taking on more risk, this system flags that change in volatility

155
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,050
almost immediately.

156
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,170
And this focus on agility, on precise risk measurement, it becomes exponentially more

157
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,970
vital when we step into these complex illiquid asset classes where valuations aren't so

158
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,470
transparent.

159
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,689
Let's look at private equity, specifically the secondary market, which is now a massive

160
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:22,769
institutional segment.

161
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:29,870
We see three distinct structural strategies that really showcase a clear risk-return tradeoff.

162
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:33,090
It's a beautiful masterclass in customizing risk exposure.

163
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,889
At the top of the risk curve, you have traditional secondaries.

164
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,110
They are simply buying old fund stakes, taking full equity risk.

165
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,230
They have the highest potential return but also the highest volatility.

166
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,450
They're just fully exposed to the economic cycle.

167
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,909
Then we move down the curve to preferred capital strategies, which are becoming much more common.

168
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:56,129
How does that preferred equity structure actually mitigate the risk?

169
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:59,690
They trade some of that massive upside for explicit downside protection.

170
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:03,049
They use a preferred equity layer that gets paid out ahead of the general partners.

171
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:03,529
I see.

172
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:10,950
They aim for returns in the mid-teens, say, an IRR of 1.4x to 1.5x, but with significantly

173
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,850
lower volatility than traditional equity.

174
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,789
Their due diligence, it focuses heavily on metrics like low leverage and stable performance

175
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:19,350
in the underlying portfolio companies.

176
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,529
They need confidence in the quality of the cash flow.

177
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,590
Okay, so they sacrifice a little potential alpha for structural safety.

178
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,850
But at the absolute bottom of the risk spectrum, you have debt financing strategies in the

179
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,669
secondary market.

180
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,509
You call this the lowest risk structure, but aren't they just trade in market risk for

181
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:39,070
credit risk?

182
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,789
That's a great critical question, but their structure is designed to mitigate that credit

183
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:45,149
risk so aggressively.

184
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,049
These debt providers are focused solely on capital repayment.

185
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:55,590
They secure their investment with extreme downside protection tools like financial covenants

186
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,629
and demanding a very high asset cover, something like 5.0x asset cover.

187
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:01,529
Five times.

188
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,350
Yeah, five times.

189
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,529
So that level of safety essentially means repayment is guaranteed regardless of whether

190
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,110
the portfolio companies hit their growth targets or not.

191
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,750
Precisely.

192
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,649
They've effectively ring-fenced their capital.

193
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,889
The cost of this certainty is the lowest return.

194
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:19,149
They're targeting only a small multiple, maybe 1.1x with virtually no expected volatility.

195
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,149
It's a perfect spectrum.

196
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,690
It shows that institutional investors are using these complex structures to buy precisely

197
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,409
the risk profile they need, whether it's full equity exposure or pure capital preservation.

198
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:35,409
Okay, let's pivot to infrastructure and clean energy infrastructure, CEI.

199
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,590
These are long-term utility-like assets.

200
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,990
What are the unique risks here and the corresponding mitigation solutions?

201
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,070
For traditional regulated infrastructure, the primary risk is, well, regulatory risk.

202
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:54,049
Since the regulator sets the allowable return on equity, the utility's profitability is

203
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:55,389
tied to that third-party decision.

204
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:00,190
The mitigation solution is largely qualitative and surprisingly relationship-driven.

205
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,330
You foster a strong long-term relationship with the regulator by consistently demonstrating

206
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,950
maximized operational efficiency and superb service quality.

207
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,450
You want to be the least objectionable partner possible.

208
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,570
That makes perfect sense.

209
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,389
You manage the risk by managing the relationship, proving you're a good corporate citizen.

210
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,070
What about assets where usage volume is the risk, like a toll road?

211
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:22,129
That's pure volume or patronage risk.

212
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:25,990
And here, the mitigation is fiercely quantitative.

213
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,830
On acquisition, managers have to conduct robust sensitivity analysis.

214
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:37,149
The key detail here is that the analysis must allow for downside scenarios that are larger

215
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:38,850
than have historically been experienced.

216
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,330
You can't just rely on the past.

217
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:46,149
You cannot rely on the past 20 years of traffic data to predict the next big economic shock.

218
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:48,990
That echoes the philosophical point we're saving for the end.

219
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,889
Now, what about CEI, solar, wind?

220
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,909
Their risk is whether the sun shines or the wind blows.

221
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:56,549
That is production risk, yeah.

222
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:01,090
And wind power is notably more volatile than solar PV, which is relatively predictable.

223
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:05,110
To mitigate this, managers use extremely conservative planning assumptions.

224
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:09,889
Instead of assuming the P50 mean output, the expected average, they use the P90 production level.

225
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:11,029
The P90 level.

226
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,289
So that means they only assume a level of output that is 90% likely to be exceeded.

227
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,090
They're dramatically under-promising.

228
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:17,669
Exactly.

229
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,970
This drastically reduces the revenue assumption in the model, building in a huge buffer.

230
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:25,789
But the most important capital protection, it comes from the dual revenue stream.

231
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,610
Even if policy incentives like renewable energy credits or RECs are completely abolished,

232
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:39,570
an extreme adverse scenario, the ongoing revenues from the actual energy sales still provide

233
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,070
substantial capital protection.

234
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,090
They underwrite the invested capital.

235
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:47,110
The ability to sell electrons guarantees a floor under the investment.

236
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,350
We've covered market risk, we've covered asset risk, but let's look internally.

237
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:57,070
For large investors, a manager's operational failure, I mean, internal fraud, conflicts

238
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,350
of interest, that can be just as catastrophic as a market crash.

239
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,029
How do LPs protect themselves from the risk inherent in the people managing the money?

240
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,769
This is where rigorous operational due diligence or ODD comes in.

241
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:13,529
LPs use ODD to mitigate risks related to valuation practices, potential conflicts of interest,

242
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:13,990
for instance.

243
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,289
If a manager has a private undisclosed stake in a portfolio company, they are investing

244
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,169
client money into.

245
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,850
Oh, wow.

246
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,110
And crucial compliance issues like trading on material on public information, MMPI.

247
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,629
So ODD is essentially due diligence on the manager's character in their process, not

248
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,029
just their investment track record.

249
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,950
You need to know that the firm running your money has the internal integrity and the controls

250
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,529
to handle massive amounts of capital ethically.

251
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,210
It requires deep, structured investigation.

252
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:46,269
That includes a comprehensive background check covering the criminal, litigation, regulatory,

253
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,250
and media history of all key personnel.

254
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,870
The firm's entire organizational structure becomes as important as its portfolio construction

255
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,350
strategy.

256
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,049
Okay, switching gears to measurement.

257
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,450
With all these complex, bespoke strategies in private markets, comparing performance

258
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,950
across managers must be a statistical nightmare without a standard.

259
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,009
Standardization is absolutely critical.

260
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,289
Yeah.

261
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:10,809
And GIPs, the Global Investment Performance Standards, is the solution.

262
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:16,690
GPS provides rigorous guidelines specifically to ensure equitable and commensurate comparisons.

263
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,090
What are the key rules GIPs mandates?

264
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,470
Crucially, returns must be calculated net of fees.

265
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,429
And because the internal rate of return, the IRR, can be easily manipulated or misunderstood,

266
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,830
GIPs demands performance be presented using both IRR and the essential cash flow multiples.

267
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:32,750
Like DPI.

268
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,409
Exactly.

269
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:40,190
DPI, which is Distributions to Paid in Capital, TVPI, Total Value to Paid in, and RVPI, Residual

270
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,629
Value.

271
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,750
You need to know how much cash has actually been returned to you, which is what DPI tells

272
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,070
you, not just some theoretical rate of return.

273
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:53,009
And valuations must be on a fair value basis, which eliminates the old tricks of managers

274
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:55,009
holding assets that cost for way too long.

275
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,830
Precisely.

276
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,610
It forces honesty and comparability.

277
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,990
We've spent this entire deep dive discussing sophisticated quantitative models, frameworks,

278
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,370
due diligence processes.

279
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,289
We've been incredibly analytical.

280
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,149
But let's just step back for a final philosophical observation about the limitations of all of

281
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:11,750
these solutions.

282
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,429
This is, for me, the most profound lesson from the source material.

283
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:20,470
It's an acknowledgement that models, the CAPM, MVO, value at risk, or even the exponential

284
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,929
weighting we talked about, are merely abstractions removed from reality.

285
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,809
Just abstractions.

286
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,490
They're useful directional tools.

287
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,029
They help test conclusions.

288
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:32,649
But they are inherently structurally flawed because they rely on past data.

289
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,929
They cannot possibly account for never before seen events.

290
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,970
They give us a clear view of the road behind us, but no guarantee about the road ahead.

291
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:43,190
So true risk of management, therefore, must be forward looking.

292
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,269
It requires qualitative theory.

293
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,549
It requires the imagination to conceive of how the world may sentimentally change, like

294
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:56,690
a global pandemic or a new financial structure, and then taking proactive action accordingly

295
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,990
without waiting for the model to register a change.

296
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,330
So what does this all mean for you, our listener?

297
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,850
We've seen institutional finance move from simple asset buckets to these highly defined

298
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,750
actively managed risk budgets.

299
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,789
And it's driven by the absolute necessity of robustness when dealing with complex illiquid

300
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:13,330
assets.

301
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:18,169
We cover the theoretical stability of risk budgeting, the need for the risk allocation

302
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:23,950
framework to expose hidden risks like equity beta, and the practical downside protections

303
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,870
employed everywhere from secondary private equity funds to the conservative P90 output

304
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,070
assumptions in a solar farm.

305
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,110
And we end on that powerful grounding realization.

306
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:38,049
The core message here is not to trust the math, but to trust your judgment.

307
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,190
The sources state, reliance on models and extrapolation of the past into the future

308
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,710
is not risk management.

309
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:50,370
Understanding the limitations of past patterns and taking action accordingly, that is risk

310
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:50,870
management.

311
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:52,529
That is the ultimate challenge.

312
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:56,970
If you manage a complex portfolio, or even if you're just making large life decisions,

313
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:02,429
where are you relying too heavily on the predictable patterns of the past instead of actively using

314
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,910
your imagination to prepare for an unprecedented future?

315
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,269
Something critical for you to mull over until our next deep dive.

316
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,769
Thanks for guiding us through all this.

317
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,450
Always a pleasure.
