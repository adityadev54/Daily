1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,940
That has to be one of the most paradoxical, but brilliant pieces of advice ever given.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,480
It really is. And it comes from, of course, the late Charlie Munger.

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,400
That single sentence is pretty much the core of the mental model we're

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,019
diving into today. Inversion. Right.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,260
Inversion is, well, it's a way of thinking that just flips the whole problem

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,579
solving script on its head.

8
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,899
So instead of asking, how do I succeed?

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,899
Which is what everyone does.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,179
Which is what we all do naturally.

11
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:32,340
You stop and you ask the reverse, what would guarantee I fail completely?

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,060
And how do I make sure to avoid that?

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,899
And our mission today is really to unpack this.

14
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:43,060
This critical skill is used by some of the greatest thinkers, but it's so simple.

15
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,479
We're hoping to give you a kind of shortcut to making better decisions, not by, you know,

16
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,100
chasing genius, but by focusing on the power of subtraction.

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,100
Systematically getting rid of the dumb mistakes that trip everyone else up.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,359
It's like finding the ultimate avoid stupidity filter.

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,280
It makes everything clearer and safer.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,979
OK, so let's get into it.

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,859
This whole idea of thinking backward.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,620
It's not new, right?

23
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,340
This isn't some modern invention from finance bros.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,079
Not at all. It has incredibly deep historical roots.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,700
I mean, we're talking more than 2000 years ago with the ancient stoic philosophers.

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,659
The stoics.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:19,900
Yeah.

28
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,560
Like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca.

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,219
Exactly. Those guys.

30
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,480
They practice this daily ritual called premeditatio malorum.

31
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,180
Which sounds intense. The premeditation of evils.

32
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,140
It does. And we think of stoicism as being about, you know, staying calm.

33
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,200
But this exercise was proactive.

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,700
So what did they actually do?

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,480
Before a big day, they'd vividly imagine the worst case scenario.

36
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,260
I mean, really picture it.

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,120
Losing their job, being humiliated in public, getting thrown in jail.

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,079
OK, but why?

39
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,459
Why would you want to put yourself through that intentionally?

40
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:55,799
Well, it wasn't about scaring yourself. It was about stealing fear's power.

41
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,799
By walking through the disaster in your mind, a couple of things happen.

42
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,719
First, you realize you could probably handle it emotionally.

43
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,859
It's not a shock anymore.

44
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,760
Right. You've already lived it once in your head.

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,340
And second, and this is the key part for inversion,

46
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,919
it forces you to see the steps that could lead to that disaster.

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,020
So you can actively plan to prevent them.

48
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,000
The stoics knew that avoiding a terrible life was a more reliable path than just,

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,060
you know, hoping for a perfect one.

50
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,219
That's a huge shift in focus, preemptive prevention.

51
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,520
But this ancient idea, it found a new home somewhere completely different.

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,219
It did. Fast forward to the 19th century with a German mathematician, Carl Jacobi.

53
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,000
In mathematics.

54
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:35,939
Of all places.

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,740
He took this concept and boiled it down to a simple motto,

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,840
man muss immer umkehren, which basically means invert, always invert.

57
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,900
So how does a mathematician use this?

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,439
Well, when he was stuck on a really complex equation,

59
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,039
instead of trying to force a solution forward, he just start at the end result and work backward.

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,960
And he found that a lot of the time, the solution just revealed itself.

61
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,639
So that's the through line from the stoics to Munger.

62
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,039
The power is in figuring out how you might fail so you can build a system to avoid it.

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,099
Exactly. It's about elimination, defining what you want

64
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,740
by first figuring out everything you don't want and then just subtracting it.

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,060
Okay, let's make this really concrete with a visual.

66
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,219
I think this helps a lot.

67
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,659
Imagine you're at the start of a massive complicated maze.

68
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:25,360
You start walking forward, you hit a dead end, you turn back, you hit another one.

69
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,120
It's frustrating, it's slow, it's just inefficient.

70
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,120
We've all been there.

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,259
But if you use inversion, you just go to the end,

72
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,180
you start at the exit and you solve it backward.

73
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,199
Suddenly, all those dead ends don't matter, the path becomes obvious.

74
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:41,979
The problem just gets so much easier to solve.

75
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,199
You're not searching for the one right path, you're eliminating all the wrong ones.

76
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:51,360
And it's that exact clarity that Charlie Munger brought into the chaotic world of finance.

77
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,099
Munger took Jacobi's role and applied it to everything.

78
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,659
And it led to his foundational principle, which is worth saying again.

79
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,180
It is remarkable how much long-term advantage we have gotten by trying to be

80
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,620
consistently not stupid instead of trying to be very intelligent.

81
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,340
That quote is, it's so deceptively simple.

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,120
Because the normal approach is, how do I find the next huge stock?

83
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,759
Munger flips that completely, he inverts it.

84
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,199
The problem for him isn't how do I get rich?

85
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,620
It's how do I not lose money?

86
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,759
If you solve for that, the getting rich part tends to take care of itself.

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,540
But couldn't that lead to analysis paralysis?

88
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,379
If you're only focused on avoiding failure,

89
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,100
how do you ever actually take a risk and do something?

90
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,699
That is a great question and it's a real risk.

91
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,920
But the key is the kind of mistake you're trying to avoid.

92
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,560
Munger's not worried about missing a small opportunity.

93
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,639
He's worried about the big ones.

94
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,300
The ones that take you out of the game for good.

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,939
The permanent mistakes.

96
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,279
So his inversion process isn't about avoiding every tiny risk.

97
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,899
It's about avoiding the things that guarantee destruction.

98
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,540
Like what?

99
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,779
Like taking on way too much debt, investing in businesses you don't understand,

100
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,860
or making emotional impulsive trades.

101
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,319
Those are the things that cause catastrophic loss.

102
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,019
That's the subtraction mindset.

103
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,860
You focus on eliminating harm, which is way easier and more predictable

104
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,019
than trying to engineer some brilliant success.

105
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,079
Okay, so this is where it gets really useful for all of us.

106
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,699
How do we take this philosophy and turn it into a tool we can use every day?

107
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,259
Right.

108
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,639
This is where it goes from an idea to a structured technique.

109
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,579
When we start a new project, our default question is always aspirational.

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,620
What do we need to do to succeed?

111
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,839
But the inverted question is the opposite.

112
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,660
It's what could happen that would absolutely stop us?

113
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,259
Or maybe even how could this whole thing fail?

114
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,740
And how would I personally be responsible for that failure?

115
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,139
That inverted question is so powerful because it fights our own biases.

116
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,879
We all have confirmation bias.

117
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,019
We look for evidence that we're right and we have optimism bias.

118
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,319
We just assume things will work out.

119
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,500
So inversion forces you to actively look for the flaws to try to prove yourself wrong.

120
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,019
Yes, it's a safety check on your own confidence.

121
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,740
And the best, most structured way to do this is a technique called the failure premortem.

122
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,959
The failure premortem.

123
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,680
Okay, I love that name.

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,139
It's a gold standard technique now.

125
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,600
And it's so simple.

126
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,120
Before you start a big project, you imagine it's six months in the future and it has failed.

127
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,980
I mean, failed spectacularly.

128
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,500
And then what?

129
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,519
You hold a meeting.

130
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,860
And everyone on the team has to write an obituary for the project.

131
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,839
You tell the story of how it failed, what went wrong, was it a competitor,

132
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,759
did the team fall apart, did we miss a deadline?

133
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,000
That sounds incredibly uncomfortable.

134
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,939
It is.

135
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,279
But that discomfort is why it works.

136
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,579
It overcomes what we call distance from the consequences.

137
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,740
A small bad decision today might not seem like a big deal.

138
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,519
Until six months later when it blows everything up.

139
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,079
Exactly.

140
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,220
The premortem makes those consequences feel immediate.

141
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,360
And it also gives people permission to voice their doubts.

142
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,879
It makes it safe to say, hey, I'm worried about this without being seen as negative.

143
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,899
You're basically harvesting all the negative intelligence up front

144
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,779
and turning it into a positive action plan.

145
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,379
That's it.

146
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,600
And for anyone listening who wants to use this, there's a really clear five-step process.

147
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,620
Okay, let's walk through it.

148
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,800
Step one is, state your goal.

149
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,920
Be specific.

150
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,339
Write down exactly what success looks like.

151
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,759
Then step two, invert the question.

152
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,199
Immediately flip it.

153
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
What does spectacular failure look like?

154
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:22,379
Not just missing the goal, but the worst possible outcome.

155
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,959
Step three, explore the causes of failure.

156
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,800
Brainstorm every single thing that could lead to that disaster.

157
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,819
Be ruthless.

158
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,240
Bad marketing, a buggy product, a key person quitting.

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:34,860
Right.

160
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,259
Then step four is a bit different.

161
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,819
Way pros and cons inverted.

162
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,199
Usually we look at the upside of our options.

163
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,779
Here you look at the downside.

164
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,100
For each choice you have, you ask what weakness in this specific option

165
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,600
could lead to one of those failures we just listed.

166
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,019
So if I'm choosing a supplier, I don't just look at the price.

167
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,459
I ask which one's shaky logistics are more likely to kill my whole project six months from now.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,480
Precisely.

169
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,959
You're stress testing your choices against failure.

170
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,740
And then finally, step five, implement an action plan.

171
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,860
You build a strategy specifically designed to avoid or fix every cause of failure you identified.

172
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,000
You build guardrails around disaster.

173
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,740
So this applies to, well, everything.

174
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,740
It's not just for big corporate projects.

175
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,139
The beauty here is how versatile it is.

176
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,620
It's like anti-advice for your entire life.

177
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,379
Absolutely.

178
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,620
Think about leadership.

179
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,720
Instead of asking, how can I be a great leader, invert it.

180
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,639
What would I have to do every day to be the most demoralizing, parable leader imaginable?

181
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,440
You'd immediately think of things like micromanaging,

182
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,320
taking credit for other people's work, never giving feedback.

183
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,019
Exactly.

184
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,639
Once you have that list, your leadership plan is simple.

185
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,480
Just don't do those things.

186
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,519
You spend all your energy eliminating harmful actions

187
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,220
instead of chasing vague, good leader traits.

188
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,740
Or what about just being productive?

189
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,200
Instead of, how do I get more done, you could ask.

190
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,120
What are the things that make us unproductive?

191
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,899
What wastes the most time?

192
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,720
The answer isn't a new app.

193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,240
It's probably too many meetings or a culture where people are afraid to admit mistakes early.

194
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,639
You eliminate the friction.

195
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,000
It even works for personal stuff.

196
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:07,500
Right.

197
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,039
Relationships.

198
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,039
What behaviors would absolutely destroy this relationship?

199
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,779
Lying, neglect, secrets.

200
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,879
You know what they are, so you focus on avoiding those.

201
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,919
It's a much surer path to a stable relationship than, you know, planning one big romantic gesture.

202
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,600
So at its core, inversion is really a tool to fight our own wiring, our bias for action.

203
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,340
We always want to do something.

204
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,019
But sometimes the most powerful action is inaction, the discipline to avoid an obvious mistake.

205
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,000
It's about constant self-criticism to prevent those big errors from piling up.

206
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,299
Okay.

207
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,659
To bring this all home, let's summarize the key takeaways from this deep dive.

208
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,519
I think the first one is just, the goal is avoidance.

209
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,460
Success usually comes from consistently not making dumb mistakes,

210
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,580
not from one single brilliant move.

211
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,679
Avoiding stupidity is easier and less risky than chasing brilliance.

212
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,559
Second takeaway.

213
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,600
Practice the pre-mortem.

214
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,340
Seriously, use this technique.

215
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,980
Before any big project, imagine it has failed.

216
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,419
Write the story of why.

217
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,360
It will save you so much pain later.

218
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,840
Make it a mandatory step for your team or even just for yourself.

219
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,279
And third, find the anti-advice.

220
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,139
Invert your goals in your career, in your finances, in your relationships.

221
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:20,820
Figure out what guaranteed failure looks like and then systematically eliminate those behaviors first.

222
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,320
Build your success on a foundation of subtraction.

223
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,879
And just remember, blindly chasing success is always high risk.

224
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,720
But preventing failure using this disciplined approach, that carries very little risk.

225
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,899
It's a much more reliable path to progress.

226
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,820
So the next time you feel stuck, just remember Jacoby and Munger.

227
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,120
Ask yourself, if this all goes horribly wrong in six months,

228
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,220
what's the one obvious mistake I made today that caused it?

229
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,440
And how can I fix that before the sun goes down?

230
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,419
That answer, that might be the biggest breakthrough you have all week.

231
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
What stands out to you?
