1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,779
I want you to anchor yourself in two numbers right now.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,679
They really define the strategic challenge of our time.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,259
The first number is $65 million.

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:14,140
That is the conventional sort of accepted price tag

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,579
for building a modern orbital class rocket.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,019
65 million.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,539
The benchmark, you know,

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,800
the number everyone just accepts is reality.

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:23,640
Exactly.

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,160
Now hold onto the second number, $2 million.

11
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,120
Okay.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,899
That figure represents the actual objective,

13
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,380
theoretical minimum cost of the raw materials,

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,399
the high grade aluminum, the titanium, copper, carbon fiber,

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,520
all the stuff you need to build that exact same rocket.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,780
So wait, you're saying the fundamental material cost

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,979
is just over 2% of the final price?

18
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:46,439
Just over 2%.

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:46,780
Wow.

20
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,859
That massive, nearly 97% gap.

21
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:50,179
Yeah.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,000
It's not filled by physics or necessary complexity.

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,140
It's filled by something else.

24
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,399
Yeah.

25
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,280
That right there, that's the opportunity.

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,899
That 97% gap, that's the whole ball game.

27
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,960
It basically screams that the cost problem

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,379
isn't a science problem, it's just a history problem.

29
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:04,659
Right.

30
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,900
So our mission in this deep dive is to explore the tool

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,180
that world-class innovators use to attack that history.

32
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,299
We're diving deep into what's called

33
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,579
first principles thinking, or FPT.

34
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,900
And really what we're exploring is the intellectual courage

35
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,540
it takes to choose rigor over ease.

36
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,980
I mean, most people and most companies,

37
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,920
they reason by analogy.

38
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,620
It's the default path, right?

39
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,920
It's mentally easier.

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,459
Totally.

41
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,700
We look at the past and we just assume

42
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,079
the future has to resemble it.

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
We say, well, rockets cost 65 million

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,140
because that's what rockets have always cost.

45
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:41,680
So we have to build our business around that price.

46
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,219
Exactly.

47
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,859
And your vision is immediately constrained.

48
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,579
You might make it 5% better, maybe 10% cheaper

49
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,459
by tweaking your supply chain,

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,680
but you are still completely trapped

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,099
inside that conventional frame.

52
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,060
FPT demands that we just ignore those conventions.

53
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,299
We boil everything down to its foundational objective truths.

54
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,859
And while this feels so modern, so revolutionary,

55
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,120
it's actually not new at all, is it?

56
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:05,939
Not at all.

57
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,199
It's rooted in a philosophical tradition

58
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,500
laid down by Aristotle.

59
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:12,120
He was obsessed with moving past in doxa,

60
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,719
the things known to us.

61
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,740
So common beliefs, accepted theories.

62
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,400
He wanted to move from that to things known by nature,

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,080
the objective principles that actually govern the world.

64
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,360
So this deep dive is basically the mental blueprint

65
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,819
for mastering that shift.

66
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,520
That's the goal.

67
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,139
Okay, let's unpack this with a relatable story first

68
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:34,439
because I think we all do this

69
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,800
analogical thinking all the time.

70
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,620
Think about that simple human tendency

71
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,000
to just stop asking why.

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,479
Oh, it starts so young.

73
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,680
You see it with kids, right?

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,419
That relentless questioning.

75
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,300
Yes, why is the sky blue?

76
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,580
Why is the sun hot?

77
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,180
Why do I have to eat my vegetables?

78
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,699
That sequence of whys is the purest form

79
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,180
of first principles analysis.

80
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,240
The child is literally trying to deconstruct the world.

81
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,400
And what always happens, questioning goes on and on

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,080
until the adult's answer finally becomes,

83
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,340
because I said so.

84
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,099
Or, and this is more telling,

85
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,300
the adult realizes their own supposedly deep knowledge

86
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,620
is actually pretty fragile.

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,719
They don't know the full chain of cause and effect.

88
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,599
Exactly.

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,780
They stop asking why, right at the point

90
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,379
where the answer demands real intellectual effort.

91
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,699
And that fragility translates directly

92
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,620
into corporate inertia.

93
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,520
In business, reasoning by analogy

94
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,879
is like a comfort blanket.

95
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,060
You look at the market leaders,

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,879
you look at your own history,

97
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,580
and you just replicate them with slight adjustments.

98
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,060
We saw this failure everywhere

99
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,000
during the rise of digital disruption.

100
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,780
Yeah, the sources get into this.

101
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,180
When legacy companies saw these disruptors gaining traction,

102
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:46,719
their response was often,

103
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,360
oh, the competitor is digital,

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,139
so we should launch an e-commerce platform

105
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,360
and become digital too.

106
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,500
That is such a superficial diagnosis.

107
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,340
It's replicating the outward form, the website,

108
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,639
without analyzing the underlying substance.

109
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,979
They failed to ask the ultimate why.

110
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,120
Right, why is the disruptor actually succeeding?

111
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,879
It wasn't just because they had a website,

112
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,719
it was because their unit economics,

113
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,900
built from the ground up, were fundamentally different.

114
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,099
Their cost structure was maybe 80% lower,

115
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,039
because they didn't have to carry all that baggage.

116
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,079
Like retail rents, massive legacy inventory systems.

117
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,019
Geographical restrictions, all of it.

118
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,879
They stopped the why game way too soon.

119
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,160
So FPT is the antidote.

120
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,439
It demands the courage to question

121
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:29,079
the foundational beliefs of your entire industry.

122
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,480
And to master it, you need a disciplined process.

123
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,399
It's not just a general mindset, it's a systematic method.

124
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,220
It really comes down to three core principles.

125
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Okay, so the first one is reduction.

126
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,300
This is where you disassemble the problem,

127
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,339
you break it down into its smallest,

128
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,720
most foundational elements, the objective truths.

129
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,639
The things that cannot be logically broken down any further.

130
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,600
Then step two, and this is arguably the hardest one,

131
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,379
challenging assumptions.

132
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,720
This is where you have to consciously identify

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,740
every framework, every convention,

134
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,560
every piece of accepted wisdom

135
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,060
that the industry has layered on top of those truths.

136
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,779
You're hunting for things that are only true

137
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,699
because we've always done it that way.

138
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,300
Right, and once you have your list of truths,

139
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,680
and you've swept away all those conventions,

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,040
then comes step three.

141
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,560
Rebuilding.

142
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,839
You construct entirely new solutions

143
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,120
based only on the objective facts you uncovered,

144
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,319
completely ignoring the old way.

145
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,680
I think the Lego block analogy here is perfect.

146
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,879
It really captures it.

147
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,519
It does.

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,459
Most people approach a complex problem

149
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,920
like rebuilding a pre-assembled Lego car.

150
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:32,860
You might take it apart into its components,

151
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,040
wheels, doors, a roof.

152
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,100
And then you rebuild it into something a little different,

153
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,779
maybe a truck.

154
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,100
That's reasoning by analogy.

155
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,279
You're limited by the original parts

156
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,959
and their existing shapes.

157
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,680
Exactly, but first principles thinking says,

158
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,759
forget the car.

159
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,500
You take the wheels, the doors, the roof,

160
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,579
and you melt all that plastic down

161
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:56,079
until you are left only with the raw material,

162
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,759
the core plastic polymers.

163
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
So you're not limited by the old shapes anymore.

164
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,819
You're only limited by the material itself

165
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,600
and, well, your imagination.

166
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,519
Precisely.

167
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,740
You are no longer building a slightly better car.

168
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,480
You can build a space station, a sword,

169
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,500
something the world has never even seen before,

170
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,600
because you started from the foundational building blocks,

171
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,180
not the previous assembly.

172
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,879
The insight is that the rules of the old assembly

173
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,019
were arbitrary,

174
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,019
but the properties of the raw material are fundamental.

175
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,060
But honestly, this sounds exhausting.

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,980
You said challenging assumptions is the hardest part.

177
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,839
How do you stop this from just becoming analysis

178
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,339
for the sake of analysis?

179
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,720
Doesn't a company risk losing all momentum?

180
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,339
That's a critical question.

181
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,279
And the rigor is the cost of entry.

182
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,980
If you don't do it, you just default back to analogy.

183
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
But the analysis isn't endless.

184
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,160
It stops when you hit a wall you cannot melt down.

185
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,439
We'll get to the formal stopping rules,

186
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,420
but first, let's see this applied in the real world.

187
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,860
Let's go back to SpaceX.

188
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,839
When Elon Musk looked at that $65 million price tag,

189
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,240
he didn't start with the budget.

190
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,480
He started with the elements.

191
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,279
He performed the ultimate reduction.

192
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:02,699
He asked, what is a rocket made of?

193
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,579
Not, what does a supplier charge me for a valve?

194
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,620
But what are the foundational materials?

195
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,620
And the analysis was, I mean, it was shocking.

196
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,560
The raw materials, the alloys, the carbon fiber, the fuel,

197
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,180
had a theoretical minimum cost of just $2 million.

198
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,639
And that huge visible gap

199
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,579
between the theoretical minimum cost, the TMC,

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,319
and the current industry cost, the CIC,

201
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,379
that is what revealed the strategic opportunity.

202
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,759
This gives us a framework for the attack.

203
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,639
The current industry cost isn't just TMC plus profit.

204
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,699
It's TMC plus a massive convention margin,

205
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,379
plus inefficiency, plus profit.

206
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,100
And in aerospace, the sources show that 83%

207
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,839
of the total cost structure was related to convention,

208
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,899
not physics.

209
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:47,259
83%.

210
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,899
The convention margin is where

211
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,639
all those industry assumptions live.

212
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,579
SpaceX realized that 20% of the cost

213
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,000
was just supplier margins.

214
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,800
Another 18% was manufacturing labor

215
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,720
tied to old bespoke techniques.

216
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,339
Another 8% was overhead baked into legacy operations.

217
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,860
So the real job wasn't optimizing the 2% material cost.

218
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,860
It was about radically deconstructing

219
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,899
that 83% convention margin.

220
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,339
And by vertically integrating,

221
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,199
literally building their own components,

222
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,259
their own alloys,

223
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,699
and redesigning the whole process for reusability,

224
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,019
they attacked the conventions, not the laws of nature.

225
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,079
And that's the target.

226
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,180
That brings up this idea

227
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,740
of the Assumption to Principle Ratio, or APR.

228
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Right, the APR is basically the percentage

229
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,139
of an industry's model that's based on convention

230
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,660
versus objective facts.

231
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,080
The higher that ratio,

232
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,860
the more assumptions are driving the cost.

233
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,340
And the riper the industry is for disruption.

234
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,399
In aerospace, that ratio was just astronomical.

235
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,519
You see the exact same pattern with PESLA

236
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,779
and the electric car battery.

237
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,799
For decades, the standard cost was set impossibly high,

238
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,179
maybe $600 or $700 per kilowatt hour.

239
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,159
That cost ceiling was a convention.

240
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,019
It was imposed by legacy supply chains

241
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,720
and old manufacturing methods.

242
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,019
So the FPT approach was to ask, what is the battery?

243
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,039
Not what does the supplier charge,

244
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,659
but what are the raw materials?

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,840
And by reducing it to its core components,

246
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,080
the raw lithium, nickel, cobalt, aluminum,

247
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,919
the analysis showed the theoretical minimum material cost

248
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,940
was only about $80 per kilowatt hour.

249
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,399
Wow.

250
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,799
That objective truth immediately redefined the boundary

251
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,600
of what was possible.

252
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,840
They knew the problem wasn't chemistry, it was convention.

253
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,340
And they set a clear $80 target.

254
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,240
And this isn't just for heavy manufacturing.

255
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,240
The XeroDah example from Stockbrokerage in India is perfect.

256
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,399
Around 2010, that industry ran on some really

257
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,679
fundamental assumptions.

258
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,559
The legacy model was built on three core conventions.

259
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,500
One, brokers need a physical high street presence.

260
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,860
Two, they have to use a high commission model,

261
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,279
especially for active traders.

262
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,139
And three, trading platforms are expensive,

263
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
complex infrastructure.

264
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,600
So XeroDah applied FPT.

265
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,240
They challenged the need for physical branches,

266
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,779
realizing that for their target demographic,

267
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,059
young tech savvy traders, it was just an unnecessary cost.

268
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,139
They challenged the commission model too.

269
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,299
They realized that volume enabled by near zero friction tech

270
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,600
could completely replace high fees.

271
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,039
So they rebuilt their whole model based only

272
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,039
on foundational principles, regulatory compliance,

273
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,720
secure settlement, and fast execution.

274
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,179
And everything else was stripped away.

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
By eliminating the conventional costs,

276
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,779
the branch network, expensive relationship managers,

277
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,759
they achieved a phenomenal 67% profit margin per customer.

278
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,720
Not by charging more.

279
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,419
Not at all.

280
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,740
But by operating on an infrastructure built

281
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,580
only upon irreducible costs.

282
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,000
That's the power of it.

283
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,379
It forces you to stop focusing on marginal gains

284
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,720
inside the framework and start looking for radical cost

285
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,200
elimination outside of it.

286
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,620
It feels revolutionary, but as you said,

287
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,620
it has this deep historical blueprint.

288
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,519
Absolutely.

289
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,339
This rigor connects us directly back to Aristotle's

290
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,340
pursuit of first philosophy.

291
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,820
His goal was to find the objective first principles

292
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,659
of the world, the features that determine truth,

293
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,720
independent of our own beliefs about them.

294
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,879
He didn't just accept common sense.

295
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,639
He used a method called dialectic.

296
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,120
Right.

297
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,799
It was a process of intense intellectual scrutiny.

298
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,840
Dialectic required finding conflicting arguments

299
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,679
and crucially demanding a vigorous defense

300
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,620
for the truth of common beliefs, the endoxa,

301
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,159
rather than just accepting them.

302
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,419
It's like putting every conventional belief on trial.

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,080
It is.

304
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,340
And the core of FPT really echoes his primary goal,

305
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,919
seeking the real essence of a thing,

306
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,860
not its accidental features like the color of a car

307
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,299
or the neighborhood of a brokerage.

308
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,039
But the property it must retain to exist in the first place.

309
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,460
That focus on defining true substance

310
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,899
is the key to objective knowledge.

311
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,700
So when we ask, what is a rocket or what is a battery,

312
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,799
we're asking what essential properties must remain

313
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,799
for it to function as that thing.

314
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,279
The titanium is essential.

315
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,519
The $60 million supplier margin is incidental.

316
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:52,240
Precisely.

317
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,759
But let's bring this back to the practical application

318
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,940
for you, the listener.

319
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,340
How do we manage that risk we talked about,

320
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:59,899
the risk of analysis paralysis,

321
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,019
where you just break down assumptions forever

322
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:02,799
without acting?

323
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,240
That is the necessary limitation.

324
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,179
FPT is a tool for better decisions,

325
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,899
not a substitute for action.

326
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,039
And the sources offer very clear stopping rules.

327
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,980
Okay, so when do you stop the analysis?

328
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,279
You stop when you hit one of two immovable constraints,

329
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,919
physics or economics?

330
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,059
Physics or economics.

331
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:22,899
If the constraint is irreducible

332
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,059
because of the immutable laws of the universe,

333
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,139
the speed of light, the strength of a material,

334
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,580
thermodynamics, the reduction is complete.

335
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,980
That's your objective principle.

336
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,860
And economics.

337
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,019
You also stop if the economic cost

338
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:36,399
of challenging the constraint

339
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,399
or maybe the political cost of implementing the change

340
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,279
outweighs the potential reward.

341
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,340
FPT has to serve innovation, not just academic curiosity.

342
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,460
So let's distill this.

343
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,940
What does this whole process mean for you right now?

344
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,620
Let's do three powerful takeaways.

345
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,899
Okay, first, focus on the essence.

346
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,580
FPT requires you to constantly answer

347
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,559
that fundamental what is it question.

348
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,879
Strip away all the layers of convention

349
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,419
and identify only the properties essential

350
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:04,539
for that thing's existence.

351
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,240
Second, you now know where to hunt for massive opportunity.

352
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,279
True disruption is found by analyzing that gap

353
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,100
between the theoretical minimum cost

354
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,919
and the current industry cost.

355
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,220
Right, if the assumption to principle ratio,

356
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,940
that amount of conventional baggage is high in your field,

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,399
you're sitting on an industry

358
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,440
that is fundamentally right for disruption.

359
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,519
And the third takeaway.

360
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,879
Third, recognize that FPT is a profound mental shift.

361
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,360
It demands continuous rigor and above all, courage.

362
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,919
You have to have the courage to ignore

363
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,120
how things are usually done.

364
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,860
I like that.

365
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,100
In a world where most people just think by analogy.

366
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,299
Those who commit to reasoning from first principles

367
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,299
possess the unique power to reshape reality itself.

368
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,519
So here's the challenge for you to take

369
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,659
into your professional or your personal life this week.

370
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,080
What cherished expensive assumption

371
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,440
in your daily processes or your industry one

372
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,299
that everyone just accepts as a given

373
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:57,200
if you broke it down to its raw components

374
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,480
is actually just waiting to be melted down

375
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,799
and rebuilt into something fundamentally superior.

376
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,019
Start asking why until the answer

377
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,639
is either physics or economics.
